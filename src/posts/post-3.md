# 30/60/90-Day DevRel Entrance Plan for Arbitrum Stylus

As I step into the Developer Advocate role, I will focus on establishing a solid foundation for Developer Relations (DevRel). This role covers four key pillars: Marketing, Enablement, Advocacy, and Community. Below is my structured 30-, 60-, and 90-day plan, which outlines key initiatives to drive engagement and success in each of these areas.

## First 30 Days: Theme - Learn

During the first month, my priority is learning and building essential relationships. Key focus areas include:

- **Building Connections**: Engage with key stakeholders across product, marketing, engineering, sales, and external teams. Connect with top community builders to align efforts and understand their perspectives.
- **Understanding Product and Market**: Dive into the product's value propositions, competitors, key user personas, monetization strategies, and community maturity.
- **Identifying Areas for Improvement**: Review documentation, tutorials, and developer guides to pinpoint areas for enhancement.
- **Exploring Value-Adding Opportunities**: Contribute by developing case studies, improving guides, organizing community events, or initiating advocacy programs.
- **Aligning DevRel Strategy**: I ensure my strategy supports both shortâ€”and long-term organizational goals and aligns with product and marketing initiatives.
- **Marketing and Branding Alignment**: Work closely with the marketing team to understand the brand's tone and voice and any regulatory considerations, especially in DeFi.
- **Documenting Learning**: I will share progress and insights through daily social media updates to build relationships, gather feedback, and establish myself as a protocol advocate.

### SMART Goals:
1. **Build Connections**: By the end of the first 30 days, meet with at least five key stakeholders and top community builders.
2. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: Complete a review of tutorials and documentation, providing a report of at least three identified areas for improvement.

## Second 30 Days: Theme - Assess

By the second month, my focus shifts to evaluating DevRel's internal impact and assessing the developer experience.

- **Evaluating DevRel's Internal Impact**: Gather feedback from internal stakeholders to understand how DevRel is perceived and position it as a strategic asset.
- **Developer Experience Audit**: Review documentation, guides, code samples, and case studies from a developer's perspective to identify pain points in the developer journey.
- **Competitor Benchmarking**: Analyze competitor products to identify areas where we can improve and differentiate our offering.
- **Collaborating with the Product Team**: I will share my findings from the audit and competitor benchmarking with the product team to develop actionable insights.
- **Educating Stakeholders**: Continuously educate internal stakeholders on the importance of DevRel and showcase its value through data and feedback.
- **Documenting and Sharing Progress**: Publish findings internally and externally to keep stakeholders and the community informed.

### SMART Goals:
1. **Developer Experience Audit**: Complete the audit by the end of the second 30 days, identifying at least one key area for improvement.
2. **Competitor Benchmarking**: Analyze at least three competitor products and present findings to stakeholders with actionable recommendations.

## Last 30 Days: Theme - Execute

In the final 30 days, I'll focus on executing key initiatives and scaling community engagement.

- **Engaging the Community**: Ramp up communication with the developer community through social media, blog posts, podcasts, and event participation (meetups, hackathons, conferences).
- **Content Creation**: Publish valuable content like case studies, technical blog posts, and developer guides to provide developers with essential resources.
- **Prioritizing Urgent Needs**: Address urgent issues like improving and maintaining documentation to enhance the developer experience.
- **Collaborating with Engineering**: Work closely with the engineering team to ensure accurate and comprehensive technical guides and resources.
- **Leveraging Stylus Benefits**: Highlight Stylus's advantages, including its interoperability with Solidity and Rust and its performance and cost benefits through WASM.
- **Onboarding New Developers**: Expand the developer base by promoting Stylus' support for languages like Rust, C, and C++, broadening its appeal.
- **Promoting Security and Efficiency**: Emphasize the security features of Rust smart contracts (e.g., reentrancy protection) and the efficiency gains using WASM.

### SMART Goals:
1. **Ramp Up Community Engagement**: Publish at least two pieces of content and participate in at least one event by the end of the last 30 days.
2. **Prioritize and Improve Documentation**: Collaborate with the engineering team to resolve at least one critical documentation issue and implement improvements by the end of the last 30 days.

## 90 Days and Beyond: Onboarding More Developers

After the foundational work in the first 90 days, the next phase focuses on scaling efforts to onboard a broader range of developers. This includes expanding outreach, creating specialized content, and optimizing the developer experience to increase adoption.

### Goals for 90 Days and Beyond:

#### 1. Expand Outreach to New Developer Communities:
- **Objective**: Target Rust, C, and C++ developers beyond traditional Ethereum and Solidity circles.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Partner with universities and coding boot camps to create educational content for building with Stylus.
  - Participate in language-specific developer forums and conferences (e.g., RustCon) to introduce Stylus and its benefits.
  - Collaborate with influencers and leaders within these communities to spread awareness of Stylus' multi-language support.

#### 2. Launch Advanced Tutorials and Content:
- **Objective**: Develop advanced, language-specific tutorials and guides for more experienced developers.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Create step-by-step video tutorials for writing and deploying smart contracts in Rust, C, and C++.
  - Develop a "Getting Started" guide for developers transitioning from traditional app development to blockchain.
  - Host live coding workshops and AMAs to provide real-time support.

#### 3. Promote the Stylus Developer Grants Program:
- **Objective**: Increase participation in the Stylus grants program.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Highlight grant success stories through blog posts, case studies, and social media.
  - Collaborate with marketing to create campaigns promoting the grants program.
  - Set up developer support to assist grant applicants with technical queries and project road mapping.

#### 4. Foster Developer-Led Initiatives:
- **Objective**: Empower developers to lead community initiatives.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Establish a developer ambassador program for experienced users to mentor and onboard new developers.
  - Organize community-driven events and encourage developer-led tutorials, blogs, and projects.
  - Offer rewards or recognition for outstanding community contributions.

#### 5. Iterate on Developer Experience Based on Feedback:
- **Objective**: Continuously improve the developer experience based on real-world feedback.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Implement a feedback loop with developers to capture pain points and suggestions for improvement.
  - Regularly update documentation, FAQs, and tools based on feedback.
  - Collaborate with product and engineering teams to address issues and ensure a seamless developer journey.

### SMART Goal for 90 Days and Beyond:
- **Specific**: Increase the number of developers building on Stylus by 20% within the next six months.
- **Measurable**: Track developer signups, smart contract deployments, and grant program participation.
- **Achievable**: Leverage partnerships, community-building initiatives, and content creation to drive growth.
- **Relevant**: Expanding the developer base is crucial to the long-term success of Stylus and Arbitrum's multi-language support strategy.
- **Time-bound**: Achieve this growth target within the next six months with regular progress assessments.

This long-term strategy ensures that the foundational work in the first 90 days translates into sustainable growth and adoption, making Stylus a go-to platform for developers across various language backgrounds.
